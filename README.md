# ABAN II

A hydrodynamic free-surface solver.

## Prerequisites

Aban ii uses [JsonCpp](http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/‎) and [Seldon 5.2](http://seldon.sourceforge.net/‎) libraries. They should be installed before compiling Aban ii. You can install `JsonCpp` in ubuntu using the following command:

    sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev

You can install `Seldon 5.2` by downlowding it from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/seldon/files/seldon-5.2.tar.bz2), unpacking it and finally copying it into `/usr/include/`:

    tar xvf seldon-5.2.tar.bz2 
    sudo cp -r seldon-5.2/ /usr/include/
