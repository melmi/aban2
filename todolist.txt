Aban 2 To-Do List:

  Fress Surface:
    ☐ Calculate interface normals using Waymouth and Yue (2010)
    ☐ Update advection of the volume fraction to use the method of Waymouth and Yue (2010)
    ☐ implement the interface rho*u advection

  Flow Solver:
    ☐ Update the code to use u again (instead of q)
    ☐ Update the code to use variable density
    ☐ Use a vector as delta

  Software:
    ☐ Organize boundary conditions for a better parameter passing to functions
      It might be by using std::bind struct.
    ☐ Accelerate the code by using the restrict keyword

  Documentation:
    ☐ Write down the mim method as described by the reference of Ham's paper
    ☐ Discuss energy conservation error
      Mention the work of Felten and Lund and show that the error of kinetic energy conservations vanishs to zero if one uses mim as above with an equi-distance surface.
    ☐ Write down overall method
    ☐ Check if there is anyway to use pagedown instead of mdwiki
